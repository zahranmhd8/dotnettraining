Boxing and Unboxing : 
________________________


The concept of converting value types to reference types known as boxing, and reference types
to value types known as unboxing. 

object is the type, that which can be used to for boxing and unboxing. 

What is the to level class in dotnet 

System.object is the top level class. 

It has predefined methods

	GetHashCode()
	GetType()
	ToString() : This method will be caled automatically once you print the object. 
	Equals() 

class Demo
{
   int a,b;
   a=5;
   b=7;
}

The above code will throw error, because statements to be written in method not in 
class directly. 

But, if you want to give default values to the member varailble of the class, then we need
the help of constructors. 

Constructors : 

A constructor is a special member, which used to initialize the member variables of the 
class, it is special because it has the same name as that of class name. 

Rules : 
_______

	-> It will not contains any return type

	-> It will not return any value

	-> It will be invoked automatically once the instance of the class created

	-> A constructor can be overloaded. 

There are 2 types of constructors known as

	(i) static constructor : These are called class constructors which are used 
		to initialize the static variables of the class, these constructors are
		invoked automatically before control reaches the entry point. 
		These constructors will not be overloaded. 

	(ii) instance constructor : These are the constructors that which are invoked 
	automatically once the instance of the class created. These constructors can be
	overloaded. 



static class : These are the class, that only contains static methods, we cannot 
create an object to the static class, we can call static methods by using class name. 

Extension Method : 

You can extend the methods of particular class from another class, known as extension method. 

This can be achieved by using static classes. 


static variables : 

These are called class variables, used to retains the old value. 

Inheritance : Deriving a new class from already existing class known as inheritance, the class which derived known as derived class, the class from which its derived known as base class. 

Through inheritance, we can reduce the size of the program. 

class First {
....
....
}

class Second : First {
....
....
....
}

Once you create an object to Second class, then you can access all public/protected
and internal members of base class. 

base keyword : If you want to pass values from derived class to base class, then we need
the help of base keyword. It has 2 forms as 

	(i) base as a keyword

	(ii) base as a constructor
